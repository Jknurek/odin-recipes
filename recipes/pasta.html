    <h1>Vodka Pasta Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      What's cool about vodka sauce isn't who came up with it, but rather how
      delicious it is. And yes, the vodka really does matter here. We know,
      because we've done the tests before. Several years ago, Kenji delved into
      the matter of whether vodka sauce really needed the vodka, and the answer
      was an unequivocal yes (though the sauce is delicious without it, too).
