    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to broil or 500 degrees. Start by preparing the
        lobster. Using kitchen shears butterfly the tail by cutting down the
        center. Loosen the meat and pull the lobster meat upward. Salt and
        pepper the meat and set on a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl whisk together the melted butter, garlic, paprika,
        thyme, rosemary, and parsley. Spread evenly on each lobster tail.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil the lobster tails for about 8-10 minutes or until the meat is
        opaque and lightly brown on the top. Serve with melted butter if
        desired.
